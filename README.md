# Dice Brand Book

## Development Mode
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

## Production Mode
1. `npm run build`

## Bundler
This site uses [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/) to compile assets and dependencies of any kind. It used to use Gulp but that's not needed.

The entry point to this project is `index.html` and Parcel.js will find everything from there to build the project.

## Development
You should use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the **ESLint** and **Prettier** extensions installed. This will help to lint the code and find bugs that may exist.
