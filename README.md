# Dice Brand Book

## Development Mode
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

## Production Mode
1. `npm run build`

## Bundler
This site uses [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/) to compile assets and dependencies of any kind. It used to use Gulp but that's not needed.

The entry point to this project is index.html and Parcel.js will find everything from there to build the project.

## Development
You should use VS Code with the Eslint and Prettier extensions installed. This will help to lint the code and find bugs that exist.
